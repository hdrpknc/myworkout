    <h2>MICHAEL B. JORDAN’S ‘CREED’ WORKOUT</h2>
    <br />
    <h3>HOW IT WORKS</h3>
    <p>
      The program consists of four workout days. For a warm-up, run one mile at
      a moderate pace.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perform the exercises as straight sets, completing all sets for one lift
      before moving to the next. Rest as little as possible between sets and the
      exercises.
    </p>
    <p>
      The only exception is on Day III, when you’ll complete the exercises 5A
      through 5E as a circuit. Complete one set of 25 reps for each. Rest after
      each exercise, then repeat the circuit two more times for three total
      circuits.
    </p>
    <p>
      When reps are marked as 10, 9, 8, 7… 2, 1, then you’ll do 10 reps on your
      first set, rest briefly, 9 reps on your second set, rest again, and so on,
      doing 1 fewer rep each set until you’ve completed 10 sets.
    </p>
